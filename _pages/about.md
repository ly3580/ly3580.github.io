I am a PhD candidate at the Shanghai Research Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems,
Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Yanjun Huang (Yangtze River Scholar).

My research focuses on causality-inspired representation learning and knowledge transfer
across embodied systems. Taking causality as a guiding principle, I study cross-embodiment
transfer from autonomous driving to robotics, with particular attention to end-to-end
learning, domain-invariant abstractions, and robustness under distribution shifts.

I am especially interested in uncertainty-aware modeling and learning transferable
representations that remain effective across heterogeneous embodiments.
